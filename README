## Workflow
##### Prepare the datasets from my own raw read counts 
```
Rscript process_mydata.R
```

##### Classify genes into different categories based on their expression patterns
```
Rscript categorize_mygenes.R
```

##### Compare the dN/dS across different gene categories based on their expression
```
Rscript compare_mydNdS.R
```
